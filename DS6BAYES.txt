# Experiment 6: Naïve Bayes Classification
# Aim:
# 1. Implement Simple Naïve Bayes classification algorithm using Python on iris.csv dataset.
# 2. Compute Confusion matrix to find TP, FP, TN, FN, Accuracy, Error rate, Precision, Recall.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

# Step 1: Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")  # iris.csv should have columns like: sepal_length, sepal_width, etc.

# Step 2: Split into features and target
X = df.drop('species', axis=1)   # Features (sepal and petal measurements)
y = df['species']                # Target (species: setosa, versicolor, virginica)

# Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets (70% train, 30% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Create and train the Naïve Bayes model
model = GaussianNB()             # GaussianNB is used for continuous numerical features
model.fit(X_train, y_train)      # Model learns from training data

# Step 5: Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)   # Predict species for unseen data

# Step 6: Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)

# Step 7: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Error Rate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)                   # Correct predictions / Total predictions
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')# Avg. of precision across all 3 species
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')      # Avg. of recall across all species
error_rate = 1 - accuracy                                   # Error Rate = 1 - Accuracy

# Step 8: Print Results
print("\nAccuracy:", round(accuracy, 2))
print("Error Rate:", round(error_rate, 2))
print("Precision:", round(precision, 2))
print("Recall:", round(recall, 2))

# VIVA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (in comments)
# --------------------------------------------

# Q1: What is Naïve Bayes?
# A: A classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem assuming all features are independent.

# Q2: What does 'naïve' mean in Naïve Bayes?
# A: It assumes all features are independent, which is a strong and naive assumption.

# Q3: Why GaussianNB is used?
# A: It assumes input features are continuous and normally distributed — perfect for iris dataset.

# Q4: What is a Confusion Matrix?
# A: A table showing correct and incorrect predictions for each class (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor).

# Q5: Define TP, FP, FN, TN.
# A: True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, True Negative — mainly for binary classes.

# Q6: What is Accuracy?
# A: Ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations.

# Q7: What is Precision?
# A: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to total predicted positives.

# Q8: What is Recall?
# A: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.

# Q9: What is Error Rate?
# A: The fraction of total predictions that are incorrect → (1 - Accuracy).

# Q10: Why split data into training and testing sets?
# A: To evaluate model performance on unseen data (generalization).
