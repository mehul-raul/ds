# Experiment 8: Data Visualization using Seaborn - Titanic dataset
# Import necessary libraries
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Titanic dataset from Seaborn
data = sns.load_dataset('titanic')

# Display the first 5 rows of the dataset for inspection
print(data.head())

# 1. Histogram of ticket fare (Distribution of numerical data)
# histplot shows the distribution of a numerical variable. We are plotting the 'fare' column.
sns.histplot(data['fare'], bins=10, kde=False)  # kde=False disables the kernel density estimation line.
plt.title("Distribution of Ticket Fare")  # Adding title to the plot
plt.xlabel("Fare")  # Label for the x-axis
plt.ylabel("Frequency")  # Label for the y-axis
plt.show()  # Display the plot

# 2. Categorical Plot - Survival Count by Class
# This plot will show the count of passengers who survived or didn't survive, categorized by class.
sns.countplot(x='class', hue='survived', data=data)
plt.title("Survival Count by Passenger Class")  # Title for the plot
plt.show()  # Display the plot

# ---- Explanation of Viva Questions and Comments ----
# Q: What is Seaborn?
# A: Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# Q: What does histplot show?
# A: histplot shows the distribution of numerical values, in this case, the distribution of the 'fare' column. It can also include a KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) curve, which smooths the histogram.

# Q: What is countplot?
# A: countplot is a bar plot that shows the count of observations in each category. Here, it shows the number of passengers who survived or did not survive, categorized by class.

# Q: What is KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)?
# A: KDE is a statistical method used to estimate the probability density function of a continuous random variable. When applied to a histogram, it smooths the bar plot and provides a clearer view of the data distribution.
