    "# Q1: What is the purpose of using groupby in pandas?\n",
    "# A1: It helps to group data based on a category (like species) to compute summary statistics for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What is the difference between mean and median?\n",
    "# A2: Mean is the average of values; median is the middle value when data is sorted. Median is better when data has outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: What does std() calculate?\n",
    "# A3: Standard deviation â€” it tells how spread out the data is from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: Why do we use describe()?\n",
    "# A4: describe() gives basic statistics like count, mean, std, min, and percentiles for quick summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: What are percentiles?\n",
    "# A5: Percentiles divide data into 100 equal parts. For example, 25% of values are below the 25th percentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: Why group numeric data by categorical columns?\n",
    "# A6: To compare statistics across different categories (e.g., comparing flower species measurements).\n",
