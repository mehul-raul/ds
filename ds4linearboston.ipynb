    "# Q1: What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "# A1: It is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between independent variables (features) and a continuous dependent variable (target).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What does fit() do?\n",
    "# A2: It trains the model on the training data to learn the relationship between features and the target variable.\n",

    "# Q3: What is the use of train_test_split?\n",
    "# A3: It splits the dataset into training and testing sets to check how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: What is y_pred?\n",
    "# A4: It contains the predicted values of housing prices generated by the trained model for the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: What is Mean Squared Error (MSE)?\n",
    "# A5: MSE is the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values. Lower MSE indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6: What is R2 Score?\n",
    "# A6: Also called the coefficient of determination, it measures how well the model's predictions fit the actual data. R2 = 1 is perfect prediction; R2 = 0 means no prediction power.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7: Why is Linear Regression used in this experiment?\n",
    "# A7: To predict continuous values (house prices) based on numerical features like number of rooms, crime rate, etc.\n",
